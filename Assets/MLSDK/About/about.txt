Special thanks to Early Alpha Users!

We want to say thank you for taking your time exploring the Massive Loop 
metaverse, working with its early SDK and being understanding as we work through
technical issues. All testers who log in at least once during Closed Alpha
testing will receive a special item as a small token of appreciation. This
keepsake will remain available on your account going forward into the live
metaverse.

HOW TO MEET UP WITH OTHERS

Although we cannot be in the alpha at all times, we will do our best to meet up with
someone during work hours (9am to 5pm CST) M-F if they would like. Feel free to
DM (direct message) the Massive Loop community managers in Discord if you want
someone to help you navigate the worlds, or even check out a world you're
working on (using the SDK). You can also use the Closed Alpha channels on Discord
to see if any other alpha members want to meet up.

Feedback:

As a member of Closed Alpha, you have the ability to provide observations and
suggestions which can refine and redefine the course of development. This is a
unique opportunity to get bugs and feedback seen by the developers and
designers behind this exciting project. While we will be reading through almost
everything you post on Discord, giving us your most thoughtful, well-presented,
and contrastive posts go a long way toward helping us understand how to make
the metaverse right for you.
